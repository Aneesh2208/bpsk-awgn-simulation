# Handwritten Notes – Digital Communication (BPSK over AWGN)

These handwritten notes document the conceptual understanding and system-level reasoning behind the BPSK digital communication project.

The notes cover:
- Overall digital communication system architecture
- Binary data generation and signal representation
- BPSK modulation and symbol mapping
- Effect of Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN)
- Receiver hard-decision demodulation
- Bit Error Rate (BER) definition and interpretation
- Theoretical BER formulation using the Q-function
- Relationship between theoretical and simulated results

These notes were written alongside the simulation work and reflect the thought process used while implementing and validating the system.

They are included for learning, explanation, and reference purposes.
